## Bayes' Rules

### Buidling up to Bayes' Rule

::: {.callout-note}
**Excercise 1**. *Comparing the prior and posterior*

For each scenario below, you're given a pair of events, $A$ and $B$. Explain what you believe to be the relationship between the posterior and prior probabilities of $B$: $P(B|A) > P(B)$ or $P(B|A) < P(B)$

a) $A=$ you just finished reading Lambda Literary Award-winning author Nicole Dennis-Benn's first novel, and you enjoyed it! $B=$ you will also enjot Benn's newest novel.

b) $A=$ it's 0 degrees Fahrenheit in Minnesota on a January day. $B=$ it will be 60 degrees tomorrow.

c) $A=$ the authors only got 3 hours of sleep last night. $B=$ the authors make several typos in their writing today.

d) $A=$ your friend includes three hashtags in their tweet. $B=$ the tweet gets retweeted.

**Solution**

a) **Answer**: $P(B|A) > P(B)$

- The prior probability, $P(B)$: The general probability that I will enjoy Benn's newest novel before reading her first one.

- The posterior probability, $P(Bâˆ£A)$, The updated probability that I will enjoy Benn's newest novel after I have read and enjoyed her first one.

The event $A$ is positive evidence that provides a reason to increase your belief in event $B$. Since I had a favorable experience with the author's work, my updated belief (the posterior) is stronger and therefore higher than your initial belief (the prior).
