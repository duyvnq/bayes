## Bayes' Rules

### Buidling up to Bayes' Rule

::: {.callout-note}
**Excercise 1**. *Comparing the prior and posterior*

For each scenario below, you're given a pair of events, $A$ and $B$. Explain what you believe to be the relationship between the posterior and prior probabilities of $B$: $P(B|A) > P(B)$ or $P(B|A) < P(B)$

a) $A=$ you just finished reading Lambda Literary Award-winning author Nicole Dennis-Benn's first novel, and you enjoyed it! $B=$ you will also enjot Benn's newest novel.

b) $A=$ it's 0 degrees Fahrenheit in Minnesota on a January day. $B=$ it will be 60 degrees tomorrow.

c) $A=$ the authors only got 3 hours of sleep last night. $B=$ the authors make several typos in their writing today.

d) $A=$ your friend includes three hashtags in their tweet. $B=$ the tweet gets retweeted.
:::

**Solution**

a) **Answer**: $P(B|A) > P(B)$

- The prior probability, $P(B)$: The general probability of enjoying Benn's newest novel before reading any of her previous work.

- The posterior probability, $P(B∣A)$: The updated probability of enjoying Benn's newest novel, given that her first novel was read and enjoyed.

The event $A$ (enjoying the first novel) is positive evidence that provides a reason to increase belief in event $B$ (enjoying the newest novel). A favorable experience with the author's work makes the updated belief (the posterior) stronger and therefore higher than the initial belief (the prior).

b) **Answer**: $P(B|A) < P(B)$

- The prior probability, $P(B)$: The general probability that it will be 60 degrees tomorrow.

- The posterior probability, $P(B∣A)$: The updated probability that it will be 60 degrees tomorrow, given that it was 0 degrees Fahrenheit yesterday.

The event $A$ (a temperature of 0°F yesterday) is negative evidence that provides a reason to decrease the belief in event $B$ (a temperature of 60°F tomorrow). A temperature of 0°F makes it significantly less likely that the temperature will be a relatively mild 60°F the next day. This new information acts as negative evidence, causing a decrease in the belief of event B.

c) **Answer**: $P(B|A) > P(B)$

- The prior probability, $P(B)$: The general probability that the authors will make several typos in their writing today.

- The posterior probability, $P(B∣A)$:  The updated probability that the authors will make several typos, given they only got 3 hours of sleep last night.

The event $A$ (only 3 hours of sleep) is positive evidence that increases the probability of event $B$ (making typos). Lack of sleep is a well-known factor that impairs cognitive function and attention to detail, making errors like typos more probable. The updated belief is therefore higher than the initial belief.

d) **Answer**: $P(B|A) > P(B)$

- The prior probability, $P(B)$: The general probability that the tweet will be retweeted. This is the baseline likelihood without knowing anything about the tweet's content or format.

- The posterior probability, $P(B∣A)$:  he updated probability that the tweet will be retweeted, given that it includes three hashtags.

The event $A$ (including three hashtags) is positive evidence that increases the probability of event $B$ (the tweet being retweeted). Research on social media engagement shows that tweets with hashtags, especially a moderate number, tend to have wider reach and higher engagement, which includes retweets. Therefore, the updated belief is higher than the initial belief.
